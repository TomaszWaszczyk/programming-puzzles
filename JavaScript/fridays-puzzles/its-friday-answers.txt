Unlike an interface declaration, which always introduces a named object type, a type alias declaration can introduce a name for any kind of type, including primitive, union, and intersection types.

By using type instead of interface the following capabilities are lost:

    An interface can be named in an extends or implements clause, but a type alias for an object type literal cannot.
    An interface can have multiple merged declarations, but a type alias for an object type literal cannot.
